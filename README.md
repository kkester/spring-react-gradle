# spring-react-gradle

### Overview

This PoC demonstrates the following architecture, design, and coding strategies:

1. A single JAR containing a React frontend and spring boot backend
2. React frontend utilizing react-router-dom and fetch
3. Gradle build file leveraging the `gradle-node-plugin`
4. Utilizing Lombok

### Running the POC

1. Execute `gradlew tasks` to see full list of tasks available with `gradle-node-plugin`
1. Execute `gradlew build --dry-run` to view list of steps included in build when using `gradle-node-plugin`
1. For the initial launch, run `gradlew npmSetup` and `gradlew npmInstall`
1. Execute `gradlew bootRun`
